    This salad of crisp cabbage, carrots, and coconut is one of those Indian dishes that takes minimal effort, doesn't involve a whole range of spices, and is ready in minutes. Dressed in an infused oil, it's the perfect side dish for a meal of rice and chicken, like Kerala-Style Chicken Curry, Easy Pressure Cooker Chicken and Chickpea Masala, or Chicken Tikka Masala. With grilling season kicking in, the salad would also make a great accompaniment to any number of grilled dishes, especially kebabs. Think of it as a slaw.

At its simplest, the dressing calls for olive oil in which you've cooked down some mustard seeds, serrano chili, and curry leaves, but you can also use a more flavorful oil like mustard, sesame, or coconut if you'd like. Crushed roasted peanuts, lime juice, and a touch of sugar round out the flavors. Leftovers make a great filling for a sandwichâ€”just add a few boiled, sliced potatoes, stuff it into some bread, and you've got lunch.

Why this recipe works:

Unlike many Indian dishes, this one requires minimal ingredients, and comes together in just about 10 minutes.
Infusing the oil with spices brings flavor to the dish that coats every ingredient.
